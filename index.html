The error message you provided indicates that JavaScript is disabled in the browser, which is preventing the toggle() function from working on the FTB Tennessee Team Schedules page. Since the page relies on JavaScript for the collapsible team schedules, this is likely causing the issue. Additionally, the message suggests that privacy-related browser extensions might interfere with the site’s functionality on x.com, but this seems unrelated to your local HTML file unless you’re hosting it on a domain with similar restrictions.
Below, I’ll address the issue and provide a fixed version of your code with improvements to ensure JavaScript functionality, handle cases where JavaScript is disabled, and maintain the requested team organization. I’ll also include a fallback for users with JavaScript disabled and ensure the toggle functionality is robust.
FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS:
	1	Ensure JavaScript is Loaded Properly:
	◦	The toggle() function is already included in your code, but I’ll ensure it’s robust and placed correctly to avoid issues.
	◦	I’ll add a 
	2	Fallback for JavaScript-Disabled Browsers:
	◦	If JavaScript is disabled, the schedules will be visible by default (not hidden) to ensure content accessibility.
	◦	I’ll modify the CSS to make ul elements visible unless JavaScript explicitly hides them.
	3	Maintain Team Organization:
	◦	The team sections are already organized as requested: 12U, 13U, 14U, 2028 (15U), 2027 (16U), and 2026 (17U).
	◦	I’ll ensure the structure remains clear and consistent.
	4	Robust Toggle Function:
	◦	I’ll enhance the toggle() function to handle edge cases and improve user experience (e.g., smooth transitions for the collapse/expand effect).
	◦	I’ll add an indicator (e.g., an arrow) to show whether a team schedule is expanded or collapsed.
	5	CSS Adjustments:
	◦	I’ll adjust the .hidden class to use display: none with a smooth transition for better UX.
	◦	I’ll ensure the schedules are visible by default and hidden only when JavaScript runs.
	6	Accessibility:
	◦	I’ll add ARIA attributes to improve accessibility for screen readers, especially for the collapsible sections.
	◦	I’ll ensure the page is usable without JavaScript for accessibility compliance.
	7	Testing for Privacy Extensions:
	◦	The error message mentions privacy extensions causing issues on x.com. Since your code is a local HTML file, this is likely irrelevant unless you’re hosting it on a server with similar restrictions. I’ll ensure the code works in a standard browser environment.
